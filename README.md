I was practicing some algorithms at codewars and I stumble upon one "kata" where I had to simulate a game's selection grid.

Then I thought, can I create a clone of the street fighter 2 selection screen by only using html, css and javascript?

So that's what I did, I found sprites of the original game, cut everything into pieces using gimp, then positioned everything on their respective position with the magic powers of css.

The behavior is the same as the original game. You can use the arrow keys or vim keys (hjkl) to move around the grid to select a player, every time you move it also dynamically change the highlighted flag on the map to match the selected character.
